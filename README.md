# Team up to solve problems on LeetCode together

## Introduction

### Code repository

ã€€The address of code repository is **[asdf2014 / algorithm](https://github.com/asdf2014/algorithm)**

### Way to sign up

ã€€Just leave a message in the comment area at the end of the "[Algorithm](https://yuzhouwan.github.io/posts/666/)" or in the [issues#40](https://github.com/asdf2014/gitment/issues/40), and you can participate at any time.

### Way to participate

ã€€Each participating partner will get the [Collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository) permission of the code repository, and can freely submit the code (unlimited language). In the `/Codes/${Your Github Account Name}`directory, each will have own code base. After leaving the Github name, you will receive an invitation immediately, you can claim it in this [link](https://github.com/asdf2014/algorithm/invitations).

```bash
# You can use the follow script to complete your first code submission for a quick start.
# Of course, if you are familiar with Git commands, you can also submit the code yourself.
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asdf2014/algorithm/master/first_commit.sh)"
```

### Frequency

ã€€Considering that there may not be much leisure time for everyone, we tentatively set the frequency of completion as "once a week".

### Problem selection strategy

ã€€The [problem selection robot](https://github.com/asdf2014/algorithm/blob/master/Picker/random_picker.py) will automatically select a problem randomly at 12 noon every Friday. The current problem is as follow:

| ID | Title |
| :-: | :--: |
| [935](https://leetcode.com/problems/orderly-queue) | Orderly Queue |

ðŸ¤–: The last update time was `2021-12-17 12:03:32`.
