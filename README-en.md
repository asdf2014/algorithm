# Leetcode teamed up

## Introduction

### Code warehouse

　Coordinates of the code repository: **[asdf2014 / algorithm](https://github.com/asdf2014/algorithm)**

### Registration route

　Just leave a message in the comment area at the end of the "[Algorithm](https://yuzhouwan.github.io/posts/666/)" or in the [issues#40](https://github.com/asdf2014/gitment/issues/40), and you can participate at any time.

### Way of participation

　Each participating partner will get the [Collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository) permission of the code repository, and can freely submit the code (unlimited language). In the `/Codes/${Your Github Account Name}`directory, each will have its own code base. After leaving the Github name, you will receive an invitation soon, you can claim it in the [asdf2014 - algorithm - invitations](https://github.com/asdf2014/algorithm/invitations) link (of course, you can also participate directly by submitting Pull Request).

```bash
# Complete your first code submission with one step
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asdf2014/algorithm/master/first_commit.sh)"
```

### Frequency

　Considering that there may not be a lot of leisure time for everyone, we tentatively set the frequency of completion as "one week a week".

### Topic strategy

　The [question selection robot](https://github.com/asdf2014/algorithm/blob/master/Picker/random_picker.py) will automatically select a question randomly at 12 noon every Friday. The current question is as follows:

| ID | Title |
| :-: | :--: |
| [1274](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-days-between-two-dates) | Number of Days Between Two Dates |

🤖: The last update time was `2021-03-12 12:20:26`.
