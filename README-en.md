# Leetcode teamed up

## Introduction

### Code warehouse

　Coordinates of the code repository: **[asdf2014 / algorithm](https://github.com/asdf2014/algorithm)**

### Registration route

　Just leave a message at the end of the "[Algorithm](https://yuzhouwan.com/posts/666/)" and you can participate at any time.

### Way of participation

　Each participating partner will get the Collaborator permission of the code repository, and can freely submit the code (unlimited language). In the `/Codes/${User}`directory, each will have its own code base. After leaving the Github name, you will receive an invitation soon, you can claim it in the [asdf2014 - algorithm - invitations](https://github.com/asdf2014/algorithm/invitations) link (of course, you can also participate directly by submitting MR)

```bash
# Complete your first code submission with one click
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asdf2014/algorithm/master/first_commit.sh)"
```

### Brush frequency

　Considering that there may not be a lot of leisure time for everyone, we tentatively set the frequency of the question as "one week a week"

### Topic strategy

　It is divided into two phases:

* The first 100 questions are classics in the classics, so we first thoroughly read these questions in the first stage.
* The second stage, **randomly selected** by the [program](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/asdf2014/algorithm/blob/master/Leetcode%20Picker/leetcode_picker.ipynb), the history question bank can be clicked on the [link](https://yuzhouwan.com/posts/666/#检索) to see

## Q & A

### Original intention

　To be honest, this is purely a public welfare project. It is just to convene everyone to brush up and communicate together. For me, at most, it is to exercise my operational ability. I have thought about the worst situation, that is, at the end, I am alone, silently brushing the questions and asking for the code inside. :sweat_smile:
